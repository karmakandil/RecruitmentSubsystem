## 📝 Key Business Rules to Implement

1. **Draft Status Enforcement:**
   - All new configurations created with `status: 'draft'`
   - Edit only allowed if `status === 'draft'`
   - Show appropriate error messages if trying to edit non-draft items

2. **Approval Workflow:**
   - After approval, item cannot be edited (must delete and recreate)
   - Show clear messaging about this restriction
   - Approval/rejection requires comments

3. **Tax Rules Special Case:**
   - Approved tax rules can be edited (for legal updates)
   - Editing approved tax rule sets it back to Draft
   - Requires re-approval

4. **Insurance Brackets:**
   - Approved by HR Manager (not Payroll Manager)
   - HR Manager can edit, approve, reject, delete

5. **Company Settings:**
   - Only one record exists
   - No approval workflow needed
   - System Admin only

## 🚀 Development Order Recommendation

### Week 1:
- **All Members:** Set up shared components (StatusBadge, ConfigurationTable, API client structure)
- **Member 1:** Start with Payroll Policies (simplest)
- **Member 2:** Start with Signing Bonuses
- **Member 3:** Start with Company Settings ✅ **CAN START IMMEDIATELY**

### 📌 Member 3 Starting Strategy (Can Start Before Members 1 & 2):

**Immediate Start (No Dependencies):**
1. ✅ Set up shared components (StatusBadge, ConfigurationTable, ApprovalModal, API client structure)
2. ✅ Build Company-Wide Settings Page
3. ✅ Build Backup Management Page

**Can Start UI Structure (Use Mock Data):**
4. ⚠️ Build Approval Dashboard UI structure (will need real data from Members 1 & 2 for full functionality)
5. ⚠️ Build Insurance Oversight Page UI structure (will need insurance brackets from Member 2)
6. ⚠️ Build Stats Dashboard UI structure (will need data from Members 1 & 2)

**Wait for Real Data:**
- Complete approval workflows (needs configurations to approve)
- Complete insurance oversight functionality (needs insurance brackets)
- Complete stats dashboard with real data (needs configuration data)

### Week 2:
- **Member 1:** Pay Grades, Pay Types, Allowances
- **Member 2:** Termination Benefits, Tax Rules
- **Member 3:** Backup page, start Approval Dashboard

### Week 3:
- **Member 1:** Polish and testing
- **Member 2:** Insurance Brackets, polish
- **Member 3:** Complete Approval Dashboard, Insurance Oversight, Stats Dashboard

### Week 4:
- **All Members:** Integration testing, bug fixes, UI/UX improvements
